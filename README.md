# Aura

Astro React frontend UI

### Homeowners utilising the Aura smart lighting and temperature control system aim to achieve the following:

---

- Effortless comfort control. Homeowners need to be able to adjust temperatures, set schedules and activate ‘auras’ from anywhere with minimal hassle quickly and easily. 

- Energy insights. Homeowners should have easy access to clear data visualisations of their energy consumption patterns, empowering them to make informed choices about reducing energy use. 

- Optimised savings. Aura should proactively suggest ‘auras’ that schedule to help homeowners save money on energy bills without sacrificing comfort. 

- Creation of ‘auras’. Homeowners should be able to schedule temperature and lighting settings that automate throughout their day, increasing comfort, and reducing the need to manually set things all the time. 

- System reliability. Aura needs to operate consistently and without errors. Homeowners should trust that their settings will be accurately implemented. 

- Intuitive and pleasing interface. The Aura interface must be visually appealing, easy to navigate and instill a sense of confidence in its users.
